This script let's you check the best timing for you sensor as other people have face timing issues
as seen on issue https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_DHT/issues/66.

By changing the variables values below you will be able to check the best timing for you sensor,
take into account that by most datasheets the timing for the sensor are 0.001 DHT22 and
0.018 for DHT11 which are the default values of the library.
